This is a version on SmartPort-sd software that uses 4 leds to show the currently active drive and drive activity.
You can also change boot drives without having to power the computer off/on. You just do a normal reboot.
(Note: under some circumtances the change boot drive will not work as expected, so you may occasionally have to power off and on!)
